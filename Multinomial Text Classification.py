CountVectorizer builds a dictionary of features and transforms documents to feature vectors. 
Once fitted, the vectorizer has built a dictionary of feature indices:  The index value of a word 
in the vocabulary is linked to its frequency in the whole training corpus.

Text preprocessing, tokenizing and filtering of stopwords are all included in CountVectorizer, 
which builds a dictionary of features and transforms documents to feature vectors.

But word counts are not enough. We need Tf-idf.

The goal of using tf-idf instead of the raw frequencies of occurrence of a token in a given document 
is to scale down the impact of tokens that occur very frequently in a given corpus and that are hence 
empirically less informative than features that occur in a small fraction of the training corpus.

Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. The term 
frequency (i.e., tf) for cat is then (3 / 100) = 0.03. Now, assume we have 10 million documents 
and the word cat appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency 
(i.e., idf) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-idf weight is the product 
of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = 0.12.

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html
scikit-learn includes several variants of the NAIVE BAYES classifier; the one most suitable for 
word counts is the multinomial variant


Every sklearn's transform's fit() just calculates the parameters (e.g. ùúá and ùúé in case of 
StandardScaler) and saves them as an internal objects state. Afterwards, you can call its transform() 
method to apply the transformation to a particular set of examples.

fit_transform() joins these two steps and is used for the initial fitting of parameters on the 
training set ùë•, but it also returns a transformed ùë•‚Ä≤. Internally, it just calls first fit() and then 
transform() on the same data.
